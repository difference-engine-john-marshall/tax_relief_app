If you are experiencing severe economic hardship, the IRS may put your account on &ldquo;Uncollectible Status.&rdquo; This means that the IRS will stop trying to collect the tax from you until your financial circumstances change for the better. Severe economic hardship means that you won&rsquo;t be able to keep your utilities running, pay rent, pay for transportation to a job, pay for necessary medical expenses, feed yourself and family, lose potential educational opportunities, or pay for clothing. </span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.3800000000000001; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; margin-left: 36pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> If the IRS grants you </span><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&ldquo;</span><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Uncollectible Status</span><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">,&rdquo;</span><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> the IRS will then routinely check back to see whether your financial situation has improved so that collection of the tax can begin again. While &ldquo;Uncollectible Status&rdquo; will not make the tax disappear, it will give you time to address any financial issues you may have. However, be aware that penalties and interest will continue to be added to the tax due even if though it is considered currently uncollectible. </span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.3800000000000001; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; margin-left: 36pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">There are two kinds of penalties that the IRS imposes, as well as interest. The first is a penalty for paying your tax late, which is due on April 15 each year. For every month that the tax is not paid, the IRS will charge half of one percent (.5%) of the tax that is owed. The late payment penalty cannot exceed 25% of the net amount of the tax due. The second penalty is a penalty for filing a tax return late. The failure-to-file penalty is calculated based on the time the tax return was supposed to be filed to the date it is actually filed. This penalty is 5% of the tax due for each month that the return is late, up to a maximum penalty of 25%. If you file your return more than 60 days after the due date, the minimum penalty is the smaller of $135 or 100% of the unpaid tax. Lastly, interest is added to any unpaid tax from the time that the payment of the tax was due until the date the tax is paid. Interest is calculated for each day your balance is not paid in full at a rate that is set by the IRS every three months. The interest is based on the unpaid amount of tax plus any late filing or late payment penalties.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.3800000000000001; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; margin-left: 36pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">As noted in the question above, the IRS only has 10 years from the date the return was filed to collect the tax from you.

When this occurs, it is possible that the tax collection period could last more than 10 years. For instance, if you file for bankruptcy and the court files an automatic stay preventing the IRS from collecting tax from you, then the time suspension will last the period of the bankruptcy case plus six months. Also, the period is suspended while the IRS is considering your request for an installment agreement, offer in compromise, or request for innocent spouse relief. The time period will begin again once the IRS accepts or rejects your offer.</span></p>"},

The first is a penalty for paying your tax late, which is due on April 15 each year. For every month that the tax is not paid, the IRS will charge half of one percent (.5%) of the tax that is owed. The late payment penalty cannot exceed 25% of the net amount of the tax due. The second penalty is a penalty for filing a tax return late. The failure-to-file penalty is calculated based on the time the tax return was supposed to be filed to the date it is actually filed. This penalty is 5% of the tax due for each month that the return is late, up to a maximum penalty of 25%. If you file your return more than 60 days after the due date, the minimum penalty is the smaller of $135 or 100% of the unpaid tax. Lastly, interest is added to any unpaid tax from the time that the payment of the tax was due until the date the tax is paid.

There are two kinds of penalties that the IRS imposes, as well as interest. The first is a penalty for paying your tax late, which is due on April 15 each year. For every month that the tax is not paid, the IRS will charge half of one percent (.5%) of the tax that is owed. The late payment penalty cannot exceed 25% of the net amount of the tax due. The second penalty is a penalty for filing a tax return late. The failure-to-file penalty is calculated based on the time the tax return was supposed to be filed to the date it is actually filed. This penalty is 5% of the tax due for each month that the return is late, up to a maximum penalty of 25%. If you file your return more than 60 days after the due date, the minimum penalty is the smaller of $135 or 100% of the unpaid tax. Lastly, interest is added to any unpaid tax from the time that the payment of the tax was due until the date the tax is paid.
